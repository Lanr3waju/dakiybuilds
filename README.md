> Dakiybuilds is a web-based construction management system, for managing construction projects, this is the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) which is still in development.

> The construction management process in Africa and a lot of countries around the world involves a lot of manual processes, and management of physical copies of documents, as well as having project managers, construction managers, contractors, builders etc. having to keep track of a lot of things in their head, all these results in poor project outcomes such as cost overruns and project delays.

> All of these problems can be greatly minimized using modern technologies and that's why dakiybuilds is being developed.
