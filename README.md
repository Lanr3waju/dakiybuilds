> This is a minimum viable product of a web based construction management system.
 > The construction management process in Africa and a lot of countries around the world involves a lot of manual processes, and management of physical copies of documents, as well as having as project managers, construction managers, contractors, builders etc. having to keep track of a lot of things in their head. All these results in poor project outcomes such as cost overruns and project delays.
 > All of these problems can be be greatly minimized using modern technologies and that's why dakiybuilds was created.
