          , a graduate of the Building Technology Department of Yaba College of
          Technology in Lagos, Nigeria. The platform was created to solve the

          After working as an Assistant Site Manager during my internship, where
          I faced the challenge of manually tracking site activities,
          interpreting blueprints, and monitoring progress, I realized the
          inefficiencies of existing workflows. This experience inspired the
          creation of DakiyBuids, a web-based construction management system
          aimed at streamlining operations and preventing delays. DakiyBuids
          continues to evolve to meet the growing needs of the industry.
